# Direct and Inverse Kinematics of Serial Manipulators (Nyrio One 6-axis Robotic Arm)

This  paper  presents  the  development  of  a  6-axisrigid body kinematics. A rigid body in three dimensions has sixdegrees of freedom composed by three translatory DOF and threerotational  DOF.  The  multiples  revolute  joints  of  the  rigid  bodyform  a  serial  chain,  which  allows  successive  rotations  about  thex, y and zaxes accomplishing a specific 3D position, this methodis the so called direct kinematics. In addition, it is also designedthe  reverse  procedure,  inverse  kinematics,  that  places  the  endof  the  kinematic  chain  (e.g.  gripper)  in  an  exact  place  with  anspecific  orientation.
